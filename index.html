                <h2>What is Body Mass Index:</h2>
                <p>BMI or Body Mass Index, a parameter used by the World Health Organization to calculate the ideal weight of each person. The index is calculated by dividing the person's weight by the person's height squared.</p>
                
                <p>Want to find out your BMI? Enter your weight and height in the calculator and compare with the indexes in the table.</p>

                <h2>Warning:</h2>
                <p> BMI is not the only aspect to be observed to determine obesity. This is because the weight composition can be affected by the person's bone structures, which means that a BMI above the ideal range does not necessarily mean excess fat.</p>

                <p>However, the index is quite useful in detecting a weight below or above the recommended one. Thus, it can be used as a personal compass to lead a healthier life. In any case you should consult a nutritionist!</p>
