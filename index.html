            <p>BMI is the acronym for Body Mass Index, a parameter used by the World Health Organization to calculate the ideal weight of each person. The index is calculated by dividing the person's weight by the person's height squared. A healthy individual presents a result between 18.5 and 24.9.</p>

                <h2>IMPORTANT:</h2>
                <p> BMI is not the only aspect to be observed to determine obesity. This is because the weight composition can be affected by the person's bone structures, which means that a BMI above the ideal range does not necessarily mean excess fat (maybe it's a person with a well-toned body).</p>

                <p>However, in general, the index is quite useful in detecting a weight below or above the recommended one. Thus, it is very common for doctors, nurses and nutritionists to use it, not to mention that it can be used as a personal compass to lead a healthier life. In any case you should consult a nutritionist!</p>
